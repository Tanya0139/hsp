## **Setup & Installation**  

### Prerequisites:  
1. Install Python and MySQL on your system.  
2. Install the `mysql-connector-python` library:  
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

### Steps:  
1. Open **MySQL** and create a database named `project`:  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE project;
   ```
2. Clone or download the project files.  
3. Run the script `table.py` to create necessary tables in the database:  
   ```bash
   python table.py
   ```
4. Run the main application `menu.py`:  
   ```bash
   python menu.py
   ```
5. Login with the username and password:  
   - Username: `vasu`  
   - Password: `vasu6072`

## **How It Works**  

1. **Login**: Secure authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the system.  
2. **Menu Options**: Once logged in, users can:  
   - Register new patients, doctors, and workers.  
   - View all records or search for specific records.  
   - Book appointments between doctors and patients.  
3. **Database Integration**: All entered data is stored in the **MySQL database**, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval.  
4. **User Interaction**: The application uses a menu-driven interface, making it intuitive and user-friendly.

## **Source Code**  

### **table.py**  
Handles the creation of tables for patient, doctor, and worker records in the MySQL database, which is h1.py here.

### **menu.py**  
Implements the menu-driven application, allowing the user to perform CRUD operations, book appointments, and view records, which is h2.py here.
